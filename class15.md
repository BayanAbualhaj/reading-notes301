* The first article talked about the point in history that turned this feild into a men dominent field, which is the 80s, when computers were more likely to be owned by boys and not girls.

* The second link shows famous tech companies and how they treat diversity.

* The third link talks about why having a diverse team is better for the company, and they had five reasons:
    1. Diverse teams are smarter and more creative
    2. Diverse companies perform better
    3. Companies are losing out on great talent (when they close themselves to one race/gender only)
    4. Diverse companies can better serve a diverse user base
    5. It’s the right thing to do


* Why Is It Important in Tech? There are various reason why inclusion is important in tech, diversity is arguably nothing without an inclusive culture to get the best from it. Here are our top 3 benefits for inclusion in the tech industry:

    1. Innovative products and services
        According to a report by The Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) when employees who are different from one another are heard and enabled to flourish, a company will benefit more from their ideas and skills. A diverse workplace whereby inclusion is at its core means there is more access to different points of views, skillsets, creative visions, approaches, and experience which is more likely to result in a tech company producing more innovative products and services for users and clients.

    2. Social responsibility
        Tech has slowly taken over most aspects of daily life from how we shop, how we travel to how we communicate with one another and receive news. Therefore some would argue that actually it is socially responsible for tech companies to not only be diverse but foster true inclusion as well. Putting the production of tech services and products in the hands of one demographic is a lot of responsibility. Especially because we live in a diverse world so the technology we’re using should be produced by a workforce reflective of the diversity of not just the countries we live in, but the world.

    3. Increasing the talent pool
        It has been widely reported that the tech industry is suffering from a skills shortage. Recent statistics from The Edge Foundation highlighted there were 600,000 tech vacancies in the UK as of summer 2018. Increasing and improving diversity and inclusion in the tech industry is an investment companies can make to increase the talent pool and lessen the skills shortage. Employers are potentially missing out on skills and ideas if they aren’t being perceived as an inclusive place to work, because people may be being put off applying for vacancies.
