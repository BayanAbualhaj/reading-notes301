# What I learned 

## jQuery is a JavaScript Library.

**jQuery is a lightweight**, “write less, do more”, JavaScript library. The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website. jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code. jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.

**using jQuery:**
you can use jQuery in you code by:

* Adding jQuery to Your Web Pages.

* Downloading jQuery.

* jQuery CDN: If you don’t want to download and host jQuery yourself, you can include it from a CDN (Content Delivery Network).

**jQuery Selectors:**
1. $(element)
2. $(#id)
3. $(.class)

## Pair Programming 

*Two heads are better than one than stop reading over my shoulder, pair programming is the practice of two developers sharing a single workstation to interactively tackle a coding task together.*


**Why pair program?**


1. Greater efficiency:
When coming up with ideas and discussing solutions out loud, two programmers may come to a solution faster than one programmer on their own.

2. Engaged collaboration:
Aspect of learning to program is knowing when to ask for help.

3. Learning from fellow students:
Working with a teammate can expose developers to techniques they otherwise would not have thought of.

4. Social skills:
When working with someone who has a different coding style, communication is key.

5. Job interview readiness:
Companies can get a better feel for how an applicant will fit into the team and their collaboration style.

6. Work environment readiness:
Code Fellows graduates who are already familiar with how pairing works can hit the ground running at a new job, with one less hurdle to overcome.
