## Heroku:
1. first step: Set up :
    * install heroku : then you can use command *heroku* in the terminal
    * Use the heroku login command to log in to the Heroku CLI
    * This authentication is required for both the heroku and git commands to work correctly
    * Before you continue, check that you have the prerequisites installed properly
    * This tutorial will work for any version of Node greater than 10 - check that it’s there
    * npm is installed with Node, so check that it’s there.
    * Now check that you have git installed. If not, install it and test again.

2. Prepare the app: To clone a local version of the sample application that you can then deploy to Heroku, execute the following commands in your local command shell or terminal:

    - git clone https://github.com/heroku/node-js-getting-started.git
    - cd node-js-getting-started

    - You now have a functioning Git repository that contains a simple application as well as a package.json file, which is used by Node’s dependency manager.

3. Deploy the app: Create an app on Heroku, which prepares Heroku to receive your source code.

    - Heroku generates a random name (in this case sharp-rain-871) for your app, or you can pass a parameter to specify your own app name.

    - now deploy ur code 
    - Now visit the app at the URL generated by its app name. As a handy shortcut, you can open the website as follows:
        - heroku open


* We will use Node.js as a server part technology for that task. Then we'll use Heroku cloud application platform to turn this local server into a world wide server.

* Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications.
