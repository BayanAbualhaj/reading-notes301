# What I learned 

## Templating with Mustache 

**Javascript templating** is a fast and efficient technique to render client-side view templates with Javascript by using a JSON data source.

**Mustache** is a logic-less template syntax. It can be used for HTML, config files, source code — anything. It works by expanding tags in a template using values provided in a hash or object.

* when we see two braces around we know it's a mustache syntax to show that it is a placeholder.

* If you intend you use mustache with Node and Express, you can use mustache-express. Mustache Express lets you use Mustache and Express together easily.


* To install Mustache-Express:
1. Configure mustache-express in your server.js/app.js/index.js file
2. Create a views folder and add some html view templates (e.g. hello.html)
3. Then in the router configuration, use res.render(TEMPLATE_NAME, JSON_DATA).


### Coders 
- we could add Code blocks & Inline code as a feature provided by Medium.

* Code block :To begin a code block, on a new line type in ``` (triple backtick).
Keyboard shortcut: ⌘ + Opt + 6 / Ctrl + Alt + 6.

* Inline code: For inline code in a paragraph, type a single backtick ` to begin and end your code. Or highlight some text and press the backtick key.

### Ruby 
**Ruby is a programming language whereas Rails is a gem, or a Ruby library.**

# Flexbox Froggy 

## Properties for the Parent (flex container)
* display

This defines a flex container; inline or block depending on the given value. It enables a flex context for all its direct children.

* flex-direction 

This establishes the main-axis, thus defining the direction flex items are placed in the flex container. Flexbox is (aside from optional wrapping) a single-direction layout concept. Think of flex items as primarily laying out either in horizontal rows or vertical columns.

* flex-wrap

By default, flex items will all try to fit onto one line. You can change that and allow the items to wrap as needed with this property.

* flex-flow 

This is a shorthand for the flex-direction and flex-wrap properties, which together define the flex container’s main and cross axes. The default value is row nowrap.
